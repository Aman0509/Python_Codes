"""
Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The benefits of
inheritance are:

- It represents real-world relationships well.
- It provides reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add
  more features to a class without modifying it.
- It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B
  would automatically inherit from class A.

Types of Inheritance:-

- Single Inheritance
- Multiple Inheritance
- Multilevel Inheritance
- Hierarchical Inheritance
- Hybrid Inheritance

# Example 1

# Example 3 - Method Resolution Order(MRO) - When we search for an attribute in a class that is involved in python
# multiple inheritance, an order is followed. First, it is searched in the current class, if not found, the search moves
# to parent class. This is left-to-right, depth first.
# To get MRO of a class, you can either use the __mro__ attribute or mro() method
# __mro__ returns a tuple and mro() returns list

class A4(A2):
    pass


print(issubclass(A3, A2))
print(issubclass(A4, A2))


# Hybrid Inheritance - When it is a combination of any 2 kind of inheritance.
