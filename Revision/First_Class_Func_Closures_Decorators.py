"""
- First Class Function - First-class functions means that the language treats functions as values â€“ that you can assign a
  function into a variable, pass it around etc.
- Properties of First Class Function:
     - A function is an instance of the Object type.
     - You can store the function in a variable.
     - You can pass the function as a parameter to another function.
     - You can return the function from a function.
     - You can store them in data structures such as hash tables, lists etc.

- Closures - A closure is a nested function which has access to a non local variable from an enclosing function that has
  finished its execution. Three characteristics of a Python closure or when can we have closures:
    - We must have a nested function
    - The nested function must refer to a value defined in a enclosing function
    - The enclosing function must return the nested function

- Closures can be use to avoid the use of global values and provide some form of data hiding.
- Closure can also provide an object oriented solution to the problem.
- When there are few methods to be implemented in a class, closures ca provide an alternate and more elegant solutions.

- Decorators use the closure and first class function's concept.
- Decorators are very powerful and useful tool in python since it allows programmers to modify the behaviour of function
  or class.
- Decorators allow us to wrap another function in order to extend the behaviour of wrapped function, without permanently
  modifying it.
- In decorators, functions are taken as the argument into another function and then called inside the wrapper function.
- A decorator takes in a function, adds some functionality and returns it.
- We can also use multiple decorators on one function.

@deco1
@deco2
def func():
    pass

func()

This will also be equivalent to when call without using * :

func = deco1(deco2(func))

"""
When you decorate a function, it loses it's own identity in form of docstring, name etc as it wrapped by another
function. Hence, to solve this issue, you can use wraps from functools module.
